1. Binary Compatibility

ABI Compatibility: Applications like Chrome and Steam depend on the application binary interface (ABI) of the system. For them to run correctly, your custom OS must be compatible with the ABI expected by most Linux applications (especially those compiled for the x86_64 architecture).

If your OS is based on Linux, ensuring ABI compatibility with the GNU C Library (glibc) is essential. glibc is a core component of most Linux distributions and provides the system calls and APIs that applications expect.

If your OS doesn't use glibc or doesn't fully support it, applications like Chrome or Steam may not run. You might need to either:

Build compatibility libraries (like glibc or a minimal subset).

Ensure that your kernel and user-space libraries are ABI-compliant with those of standard Linux distributions.



Library Dependencies: External programs often rely on shared libraries, such as libX11, libc, and others. You'll need to either:

Provide these libraries in your OS environment.

Or ensure compatibility by allowing users to install these libraries (e.g., via a package manager).



2. Package Management System

Package Manager: To easily install and manage software like Chrome or Steam, your OS will need a package manager. This is particularly useful for handling dependencies and updates.

For Linux-like systems, package managers like apt (Debian-based), yum (Red Hat-based), or pacman (Arch Linux) are common.

If you use a different model for managing software, you’ll need to ensure your OS supports the installation and running of these programs and their dependencies.


Software Distribution: Chrome, Steam, and many other apps provide packages for popular Linux distributions, such as .deb for Debian-based systems or .rpm for Red Hat-based systems. You’ll need to ensure your OS can:

Handle .deb or .rpm packages or create your own package format.

Alternatively, you can allow users to install precompiled binaries for these apps if available.



3. Graphics and Multimedia Support

GPU Drivers and OpenGL: Many external programs (e.g., Steam, Chrome) depend on GPU acceleration for rendering. For these programs to work properly:

Your OS needs to support graphics drivers for common GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel).

The kernel must support Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) and OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics.

You’ll also need X11 or Wayland as a display server to handle window management and rendering.


Video and Audio Codecs: Many programs (like Chrome, for streaming) require multimedia codecs. You'll need to ensure support for common video/audio formats like H.264, VP9, and AAC.


4. Web Browsers (e.g., Chrome)

Chromium/Chrome: Chrome relies heavily on WebKit/Blink for rendering pages. It also depends on libraries like libgnome-keyring or libdbus. To run Chrome on your custom OS, you will need to:

Provide these libraries.

Ensure your OS supports systemd or another init system to run background services for Chrome (e.g., keyring, network management).

Optionally, use sandboxing for Chrome (if your OS supports such features).



5. Gaming (e.g., Steam)

Steam and Dependencies: Steam is a platform that relies on several libraries and services like libpulse for audio, libGL for graphics, and Steam Runtime (a set of libraries packaged with Steam for compatibility across distributions).

Ensure that your OS can install and run Steam Runtime alongside the Steam client.

Make sure that your OS supports OpenGL or Vulkan for 3D acceleration.


Wine/Proton: Many games on Steam require Wine or Proton to run Windows games on Linux. You will need to:

Install and configure Wine or Proton if you want to enable the ability to run Windows applications.



6. System Services

Systemd/Init: Many Linux applications depend on systemd (or a similar init system) to manage system services like networking, logging, and device management. If your OS doesn't use systemd, you may need to write compatibility layers or manage these services manually.

X Server or Wayland: Since applications like Chrome and Steam require graphical user interfaces, you need to support an X server (such as X11) or Wayland for graphical rendering. Most Linux applications expect to interact with an X11 server for window management.


7. Security Features

AppArmor/SELinux: Some applications have security profiles (like AppArmor or SELinux), which could cause compatibility issues if your OS doesn't support these security frameworks. Ensure your OS handles security policies, or you can disable them for certain apps if needed.


How to Ensure Compatibility

Testing: Start by testing your custom OS with applications like Chrome and Steam. Try installing them manually and see if they run successfully. This will help you identify any missing dependencies or system features.

Develop Custom Installation Packages: If you're building a custom OS for specific use cases, consider creating installation scripts or package formats that bundle dependencies with the application.

Contribute to Open-Source: If your OS is open-source, contributing compatibility fixes or libraries to upstream projects (e.g., Chrome, Steam) can help others use your OS and also improve its compatibility.


Conclusion

To make external programs like Chrome or Steam compatible with your custom OS, you must ensure that:

1. Binary Compatibility with common Linux standards (especially libraries like glibc).


2. Proper Graphics and Multimedia Support (e.g., GPU drivers, OpenGL).


3. A Package Management System for easy installation and dependency management.


4. System Services like systemd or a similar init system for running background services.



By addressing these compatibility issues, you’ll be able to run a broad range of external programs, ensuring your custom OS is more versatile for end users.
